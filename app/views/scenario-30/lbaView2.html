<p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain</p>

<p>We wrote to you previously about the money owed to DWP.</p>
 <p> If you have already made an arrangement to pay or have contacted us to discuss your options, then
  please ignore this letter.</p>
  <p>A breakdown showing how much you owe is given below but you can find more information using
  our online service.</p>


<p class="mt40"><b>Breakdown of what you owe</b></p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Universal Credit overpayment &ndash; &pound;1000.00</li>
  <li>Universal Credit overpayment &ndash; &pound;920.00</li>
  <li>Universal Credit advance &ndash; &pound;2400.00</li>
</ul>

<p>Total amount owed: <b>&pound;4,320.00</b></p>



<p class="mt40">We understand it may not be possible to pay this in one go so you can set up a Direct Debit or
  flexible payment plan. Alternatively, you can make single payments to reduce the amount you owe.</p>
  
  <p>You are in control to manage the money you owe based on what you can afford and pay in a way
  that suits you. If you are struggling, you can contact us for help.</p>


<p class="mt40"><b>What you need to do next</b></p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Go to <a href="startThis">https://repay-manage-benefit-owed.service.gov.uk</a> (or you can search for ‘repay and
manage benefits money’ on the GOV.UK website)</li>
  <li><b>Enter security code 1314555353</b> &ndash; it is important to make a note of this as you will enter it
each time you sign in</li>
  <li>Enter your date of birth</li>
  <li>Set up a payment plan or make a payment</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can contact us on the number above to discuss your payment options.</p>


<p class="mt40"><b>Further action</b></p>

<p>If you don’t do anything by <b>22/07/22</b>, we may take a number of actions including contacting your
  employer to make deductions from your pay (this could be up to 20% depending on how much you
  earn).</p>
